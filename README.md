Practice Repository!

This is my first attempt at using Github! I wouldn't say it's going well yet - I just got lost clicking around in the tabs associated with this project and couldn't find how to get home. But it all worked out.

I wonder if there is a way to make this file formatted so that it's readable when you download it. Are these lines going to be annoyingly long, as happens when you open txt files in Notepad? Noting the "soft wrap" setting in the upper right, at least things will always be readable on git.
